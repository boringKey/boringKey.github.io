I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/), [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, AIGC, multi-modal learning, anomaly detection.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhang](https://vs.scu.edu.cn/info/1062/1369.htm/) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/), Sichuan University.
