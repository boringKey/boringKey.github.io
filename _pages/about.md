I'm a second year postgraduate student from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/), [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, anomaly detection, multi-modal learning and AIGC.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jianwei Zhang](https://vs.scu.edu.cn/info/1062/1369.htm/) and Prof. Yuzhong Zhong from College of Computer Science, College of Electrical Engineering, Sichuan University.

Now, I'm looking for a Ph.D postion for further research.

# Research Projects

I am currently delving into research beyond my master's studies. Up to now, my research involvement has primarily centered around AIGC and Multi-Modal learning.

## AIGC
