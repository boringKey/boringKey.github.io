I'm a second year postgraduate student from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/), [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, AIGC, multi-modal learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jianwei Zhang](https://vs.scu.edu.cn/info/1062/1369.htm/) and Prof. Yuzhong Zhong from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/), [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/).

Now, I'm looking for a PhD postion for further research.
